									Mapping Food Insecurity in Karachi

								The onset of COVID-19 and subsequent
								implementation of blanket lockdowns across
								Pakistan implied large disruptions to income for
								workers in both the formal and informal sector.
								With many Pakistanis living at or near
								subsistence levels and dependent on daily wages,
								there were concerns that the lockdown would
								result in large-scale deprivation of basic
								necessities.
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								In a project led by the World Bank, CERP Labs
								rapidly designed and built a dashboard to
								visualize data coming from automatic phone
								surveys targeting Katchi Abadis in Karachi.
								Indicators derived from waves of surveys and
								plotted on an interactive map showed hotspots in
								neighborhoods in which people had lost all their
								income, did not have money for a weeks worth of
								food supplies, and did not have access to free
								rations in their neighbourhoods.
