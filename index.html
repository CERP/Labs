									Mapping Food Insecurity in Karachi

							<div class="segment">
								The onset of COVID-19 and subsequent
								implementation of blanket lockdowns across
								Pakistan implied large disruptions to income for
								workers in both the formal and informal sector.
								With many Pakistanis living at or near
								subsistence levels and dependent on daily wages,
								there were concerns that the lockdown would
								result in large-scale deprivation of basic
								necessities.
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								In a project led by the World Bank, CERP Labs
								rapidly designed and built a dashboard to
								visualize data coming from automatic phone
								surveys targeting Katchi Abadis in Karachi.
								Indicators derived from waves of surveys and
								plotted on an interactive map showed hotspots in
								neighborhoods in which people had lost all their
								income, did not have money for a weeks worth of
								food supplies, and did not have access to free
								rations in their neighbourhoods.

								CERP researchers found that often the answer to
								the questions they were looking for with respect
								to schools attendances, enrollment, fee
								collection and grade performance was contained
								within dozens of registers maintained by the
								school administrators and teachers. Data was
								being recorded in these low-cost private
								schools, but without the ability for school
								owners to access, analyze and share it with
								parents, much of its value was lost.
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								CERP Labs worked with the CERP Education
								researchers to build an application specially
								designed to increase the management capacity of
								low-cost private schools. Labs worked in the
								field to iteratively design and prioritize
								various features with school owners, admins and
								teachers, ultimately building an application
								which synced data between different school
								devices in real-time when online, and queuing
								changes made offline on device until internet
								connectivity returned.
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								Labs formed and executed a sales strategy to
								sell the school management system in six
								districts of Punjab, managed a distributed sales
								team and housed a customer support center at
								CERP to reach over 300 schools in six months.

									IlmExchange

							</div>
							<div class=" segment">
								Labs partnered with researchers in the CERP
								Education program to create a marketplace
								connecting low-cost schools in Pakistan with
								Education Service Suppliers. School owners are
								often not exposed to several inputs that could
								be critical in improving education outcomes in
								their schools, such as loans, quality textbooks,
								and education innovations in the EdTech space.
								By creating a digital marketplace which school
								owners were comfortable browsing and ordering
								from, it could be possible to create a
								sustainable mechanism for bringing increased
								choice and awareness of these critical education
								inputs.
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								Labs piloted a one-way, and then two-way
								marketplace between low-cost private schools and
								education service providers with the creation of
								ilmexchange.com. Schools were able to browse a
								catalog of products even when offline, and sales
								coordination was done through a call-masking
								solution which protects the privacy of the
								schools while still allowing contact to take
								place between buyers and sellers. When
								commercial activity was depressed because of
								forced school closures in light of the COVID
								crisis, Labs rapidly built a free distance
								learning solution for out of school children to
								watch educational lectures curated and aligned
								to the Punjab curriculum by the CERP Education
								program. The rapid development of this feature
								has led to the merging of the MISchool and
								IlmExchange systems in order to better serve
								schools in Punjab as they emerge from this
								health crisis.
